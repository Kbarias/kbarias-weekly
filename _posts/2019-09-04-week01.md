**Summary of Week 1**  
In the class, we discussed what open source software is and we created
our account names for GitHub, Wikipedia, and OpenStreetMap.

**Why did you decide to take a course in open source software?**  
I decided to take a course in open source software because I have wanted 
to contribute to open source projects but have not been sure of how to 
get started. I have looked on Github for projects to contribute to, but 
ended up overwhelmed and in need of some guidance. I wanted to learn how 
to contribute to open source projects through coding but also in other ways, 
and I thought this course would help me in achieving this.

I created my GitHub account a while ago but have not been frequently updating 
it with the work I have been doing, and so my GitHub account is inactive. After 
asking around for information about the course, I discovered that the course 
requires you to do projects and contributions on GitHub which is a big motivation 
in getting my account to being active. Thus, I thought taking this course would 
be beneficial in teaching me about open source software, while also allowing me 
to showcase this learning.
