** Summary of Week 4 **  
In class we were shown how to work on GitHub repositories through our local
machines using git. Using this knowledge, I was able to edit my blog post for
Week 3 through my local machine's command line. I also contributed to OpenStreetMap
adding the names to a couple of pathways in a cemetery.

** Comment on your experience with the Git activity that you did in class 
today. Was it useful? Was it confusing? Did you have time to finish? Did 
you have merge conflicts? Were you able to resolve them? **  


** What are your reactions to the above on-line readings. Pick one or two
that made an impression on you and articulate your thoughts about them. **  
I really enjoyed reading the article [7 Things That Make a Great Open Source Contribution](https://blog.newrelic.com/engineering/open-source-contribution/)
because it brought attention to things that might get overlooked when you dive
into contributing. One thing that I thought was a good tip for contributing to open source
projects was to submit one issue at a time instead of combining tasks. 
This is something that I had not given much thought to but is very beneficial
to any kind of project. Before reading this article I would have combined two tasks
together thinking that I was hitting two birds with one stone. However, it now makes sense
to tackle one task at a time and submit the pull requests separately to make changes
easier to understand.
