** Summary of Week 4 **  
In class we were shown how to work on GitHub repositories through our local
machines using git. Using this knowledge, I was able to edit my blog post for
Week 3 through my local machine's command line. I also contributed to OpenStreetMap
adding the names to a couple of pathways in a cemetery.

** Comment on your experience with the Git activity that you did in class 
today. Was it useful? Was it confusing? Did you have time to finish? Did 
you have merge conflicts? Were you able to resolve them? **


** What are your reactions to the above on-line readings. Pick one or two
that made an impression on you and articulate your thoughts about them. **
