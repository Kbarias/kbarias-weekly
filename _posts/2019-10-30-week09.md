**Summary of Week 9**  

**My thoughts on Eric Raymond's [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html)**  
Prior to actually reading the book, I was confused on what the correlation was between open source and the title of the book. However, after reading the text it started to make sense on why Eric Raymond chose to compare these two things that seemlingly have no connection. This idea of a cathedral and a bazaar really stuck out to me because before I had learned about open source, I had the same idea that Raymond had about software. I thought that some of the really important and large pieces of software that we see today were built in isolation and to perfection, essentially, as Raymond would describe it, a cathedral. He then realized, like I did, that this was not in fact the case and that software development looks more similarly to a bazaar with "different agendas and approaches", and is very collaborative.  
There are several points that Raymond made that grabbed my attention. Some of them are:  
1. "When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor."  
We spoke about a similar idea when Bill Reyner visited, however, he said that when his company doesn't see any particular value in working on a side product, they might just scrap the whole project. I thought this
2. "Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone."
3. "Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away."
4. "To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you."
