**Summary of Week 6**
This week 

**Open Source Projects I looked at to potentially contribute to**  
I looked at quite a few projects that looked interesting to me. I looked at rugk's Offline QR Code Generator. This project looked very interesting but also the project seems to be pretty active where commits, PRs, and issues are recent. The maintainers seem to be very supportive of contributors where they express their gratitude for contributions. The programming language that this project uses it JavaScript. I have basic knowledge of JavaScript and so I only really see my contributions to this project to be more so about documentation rather than coding. However, I would be interested in looking at the code and see if I could contribute code. Another project I looked at was FreeCodeCamp. I am very familiar with this project's mission because I myself have used their servies. Commits, issues, and PRs are all very frequent, making the project very active. Being that the project posts coding challenges using very basic JavaScript, I can see my contributions being part of the coding curriculum. I also looked at the project called Notepad++ because I am also familiar with it, and while it is active and the community of contributors seems relatively friendly, there are so many issues and PRs that are open. This makes me think that the project is very big and the maintainers will most likely not look at PRs from beginners. Another project I thought would be interesting is 30 Seconds of Code because it seems like the type of project that is in need of many contributions because there is always content to add. 

In this week's blog, write about which projects you looked at, why you rejected them, which are still possible, and which look good to you. Treat your blog like a diary this week. Also comment on the talk by Karen Sandler.
