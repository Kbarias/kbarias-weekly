**Summary of Week 8**

This week we made a decision of which open source project we are going to work on. After looking at a few projects, I narrow

Additionally, this week we were visited by Bill Reyner who spoke about how open source is being incorporated into companies like FactSet and how they profit from this. He really emphasized how, at FactSet, they try to encourage their engineers to contribute to open source projects. I thought this was pretty cool of the company because sometimes engineers want to make a difference outside of their place of work. At the same time, they might be benefiting the company in which they work by contributing to a library that their software uses, becomming a win-win situation.


Chronicle your activities related to the project on which you are going to work. What did you do to install the developmetn environment? What issues are you considering? How are you filtering them? What are you reading? In general, write about the work you are doing on your project.
