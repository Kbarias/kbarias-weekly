**Summary of Week 8**

This week we made a decision of which open source project we are going to work on. After looking at a few projects, I narrowed it down to freeCodeCamp. Additionally, this week we were visited by Bill Reyner who spoke about how open source is being incorporated into companies like FactSet and how they profit from this. He really emphasized how, at FactSet, they try to encourage their engineers to contribute to open source projects. I thought this was pretty cool of the company because sometimes engineers want to make a difference outside of their place of work. At the same time, they might be benefiting the company in which they work by contributing to a library that their software uses, becomming a win-win situation. 

My contributions this week were ...

Chronicle your activities related to the project on which you are going to work. What did you do to install the developmetn environment? What issues are you considering? How are you filtering them? What are you reading? In general, write about the work you are doing on your project.

After chosing to work on the project, freeCodeCamp, I had the option to set it up locally or to use Gitpod as the developing environment. I decided to set up the project locally on my computer because I want to get more comfortable working with projects on the command line and using git. I appreciated that the steps to set up the project were very clear and that they were explained so that you were given knowledge on what it was that you were doing and not just blindly following steps.  
I am looking for issues that are labeled "first timers welcome", "hacktoberfest", or "help wanted".
