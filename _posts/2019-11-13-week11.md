**Summary of Week 11**  
My thoughts on Kevin Fleming's visit.  
This week Kevin Fleming of Bloomberg visited us and discussed Bloomberg's involvement in open source projects. He discussed the different open source software that the company uses, such as [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [Apache Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/). 

Going through the recent issues on the project's GitHub page, I saw that there were more issues related to curriculum this past week than prior weeks. I think that this might have been some of my doing, because the issue that I created last week brought up some other issues regarding the actual code in challenges. This week on freeCodeCamp I created another [issue](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/37748) related to the Basic JavaScript curriculum on their website. I created this issue on 11/12, as it took some time to go through the coding challenges and find things that should be edited. The issue relates to the description of the <code>.length</code> function in a JavaScript challenge. Due to the challenge being for beginners at coding, I felt that the description of the <code>.length</code> function needed to include that spaces are taken into account when calculating the length of a string. I created a [pull request](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/37749) to resolve this issue. The checks that need to be passed for the pull request to be merged into the master branch, have been passed as of 11/13. I am now waiting for a review and an approval from one of the maintainers of the project. 

This week we began contributing to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) by editing pages on the website. One of my favorite movies is [_Beaches_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaches_(film)) and so I decided to investigate the wikipedia page for this film. There were a few grammar mistakes present, so I edited the page by [correcting these errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beaches_(film)&diff=prev&oldid=925984351). I also came across the wikipedia page for the book [_It's Kind of a Funny Story_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Kind_of_a_Funny_Story). This page also contained grammar and spelling mistakes, and my corrections to the page can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=It%27s_Kind_of_a_Funny_Story&diff=prev&oldid=925985900).
