**Summary of week 10**

We started looking at ways to contribute to Wikipedia pages, and this started off as being a little difficult because there is so much content on Wikipedia that I did not know where to start contributing. I had trouble looking for pages that might need editing because they all looked very well crafted already. I then started looking at random articles and many of these are lacking information, and so I put many of these on my Watchlist to be able to come back and add information to them.
