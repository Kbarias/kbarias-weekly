**Summary of week 10**

We started looking at ways to contribute to Wikipedia pages, and this started off as being a little difficult due to there being so much content on Wikipedia that I did not know where I should start contributing. I had trouble looking for pages that might need editing because the few that I did look at all looked very well crafted. I then started looking at pages that were generated under 'Random Article' and many of these were lacking information or they had many issues. I put the ones that interest me on my Watchlist to be able to go back and add information to them.

This week on [freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp) I created an [issue](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/37682) to explain a piece of code in their basic JavaScript curriculum. I created a [pull request](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/37683) to explain a <code>while</code> loop in one of their challenges. I felt that the code needed some sort of explaination because it is to be read by someone with either no background knowledge of programming or a beginner. My PR did not pass the first round of checks but one of the maintainers reached out and suggested changes for it. It surprised me that they had gotten back to me within a couple of hours. After making the requested changes, all the checks were passed and the maintainer approved it. I am now waiting on the PR to be merged!
