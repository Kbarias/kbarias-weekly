title: Week 10

**Summary of week 10**  
We started looking at ways to contribute to Wikipedia pages, and this started off as being a little difficult due to there being so much content on Wikipedia that I did not know where I should start contributing. I had trouble looking for pages that might need editing because the few that I did look at, all looked very well crafted. I then started looking at pages that were generated under 'Random Article' and many of these were lacking information or they had many issues. I put the ones that interested me on my Watchlist to be able to go back and add information to them.

This week I looked for issues that I could possibly resolve in the [freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp) GitHub page. After being unsuccessful in looking for already proposed issues that I could solve, I began looking at the descriptions to actual coding challenges and seeing some things that could use some changes. On 11/4, I created my own [issue](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/37682) to explain a piece of code in one of the challenges of their basic JavaScript curriculum. This same day, I created a [pull request](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/37683) to explain a <code>while</code> loop in the challenge. I felt that the code needed some sort of explaination because it is to be read by someone with either no background knowledge of programming or a beginner. My PR did not pass the first round of checks but within a couple of hours one of the maintainers reached out and suggested changes for it. After making the requested changes, all the checks were passed and two maintainers approved it. I am now waiting on the PR to be merged as of 11/5. I looked at other PRs that were approved but many of them have not been merged after a long time. This is kind of concerning but if my PR does not get merged by 11/6, I will follow-up with the maintainers.

**Thoughts on "[Makers and Takers](https://dri.es/balancing-makers-and-takers-to-scale-and-sustain-open-source)" by Dries Buytaert**  
A point that Buytaert made that grabbed my attention was "Overall, the privatization and centralization of common goods has been very successful; in many countries, public transport, water utilities and parks are maintained better than volunteer contributors would have on their own. I certainly value that I don't have to help maintain the train tracks before my daily commute to work, or that I don't have to help mow the lawn in our public park before I can play soccer with my kids."
