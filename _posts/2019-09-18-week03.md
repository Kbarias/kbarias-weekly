**Summary of Week 3**  
In class, we reviewed the different types of software licenses that exist, as well as the formal definitions of "open source software" and "free software". We also began contributing to open source projects, such as OpenStreetMap.

**Write about what you have learned so far with respect to the statements in the article "10 things you should know about open source before you use it".**  
Prior to this class, I was under the impression that open source software was that reliable because anybody could do anything they wanted with the code. Also, I thought that open source software was not popular because it was harder to use and also hard to find. I now realize that there are many open source software that I have been using for a long time, such as Firefox and Notepad++. These software are very well known and reliable, where I have been using them for many years without any problems. Reading this article I now see that there are websites, like [Download.com](https://download.cnet.com), to make open source software easily available to anybody, showing just how popular it is.  

Before this class, I thought that all open source software was free and so I was very confused on how anyone would make money off of these projects. It now makes sense that these projects have different versions of the software that they build, such as a community version and other versions with added features, in order to make a profit.
