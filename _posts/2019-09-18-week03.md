**Summary of Week 3**  
In the class we looked at the different types of software licenses that exist, as well as the formal definitions of "open source software" and "free software". We also began contributing to open source projects, such as OpenStreetMap.

**Write about what you have learned so far with respect to the statements in the article "10 things you should know about open source before you use it".**  
Prior to this class, I was under the impression that open source software was not all that reliable because anybody could do anything they wanted with the code. Also, I thought that open source software was not all that popular because it was harder to use and that it was hard to find. However, I now realize that there are many open source softwares that I have been using for a long time, such as Firefox and Notepad++, that are very reliable and that are accessible to the public.  
Before this class, I thought that all open source software was free and so I was very confused on how anyone would make money off of these projects. It now makes sense that these projects have community versions and versions with added features, in order to make a profit.
