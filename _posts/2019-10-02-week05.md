**Summary of Week 5**  
This week our class focused on the [GitHub Workflow](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/csci395.86/slides/github-workflow-presentation.pdf). We did an in-class activity to practice this workflow with peers, which I felt was useful. I found this exercise to be very useful because I became more comfortable with the GitHub collaboration workflow. Since we did certain steps several times, such as posting an issue and submitting a pull request, I feel more confident in this process. The activity was a little difficult to follow at first, but after doing the steps a few times it became easier. This week I continued contributing to OpenStreetMap by adding details, such as the name and hour times, of a local church in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

**Webpages I think will help me to find projects to contribute to, based on the article, [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#finding-a-project-to-contribute-to)**  
I found that this article had a lot of useful websites that make looking for projects to contribute to much easier to find. I think that the webpage [Up For Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/#/) will be very helpful because you can find projects to contribute to by the languages they use and by the labels of their issues, for instance, they might be labeled "good first issue". The webpage [SourceSort](https://www.sourcesort.com/) is very similar and can get even more specific in helping you find the perfect project to contribute to. [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/) has the same layout as the two websites mentioned before. While looking at these webpages I was able to find a handful of projects that I would be interested in working on.
